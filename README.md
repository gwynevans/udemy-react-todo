An example React TODO project from [The Complete React Web App Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-react-web-app-developer-course/) at Udemy.

Useful build commands: (Actually just a manual CI server!)
- nodemon -w . -i public -e js,jsx -x "date & webpack -d"
- nodemon -w app -e jsx -x "npm test"
